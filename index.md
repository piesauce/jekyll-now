I am passionate about researching solutions that harness technology to help humans understand and connect to each other better. To that end, my interests lie in the field of natural language processing, with an emphasis on language modeling, information extraction, and discourse parsing. I am also interested in general machine learning/deep learning, especially transparency, explainability, and fairness of machine learning models and applications. I maintain an [NLP blog](https://www.piesauce.com/nlpblog/), where I write about recent papers in the fields of NLP/Computational Lingustics that have excited me.

In a previous life, I used to work in the field of information security at IBM, The Netherlands. I spent several wonderful years there building and learning interesting stuff. Before that, I gained a Masters degree from Eindhoven University of Technology.

The three activities that possibly give me the most pleasure are reading, eating, and walking (not necessarily in that order). I also geek out over board games, public transit systems, pro-wrestling, electoral systems, and election predictions.

If you need advice on higher education applications/universities, or need advice on immigration processes, or need career advice for software engineering, you can always shoot a mail to contact aT {{! website name}. Please note that I am not a professional in any of these fields, but I will help as much as I can :-)
