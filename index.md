I am passionate about researching solutions that harness technology to help humans understand and connect to each other better. To that end, my interests lie in the field of natural language processing, with an emphasis on natural language understanding, machine translation, and discourse parsing. I am also interested in general machine learning/deep learning, especially regarding model interpretability and dealing with bias in models and training data that have repurcussions in the real world (Fair ML). I am relatively a newbie in these fields, and I am enjoying every moment of the learning process.

Lately, I have started developing an interest in linguistics, primarily in how its ideas can be applied to natural language processing, but my knowledge in this area is quite rudimentary at the moment.

In a previous life, I used to work in the field of information security at IBM, The Netherlands. I spent several wonderful years there building and learning interesting stuff. Before that, I gained a Masters degree from Eindhoven University of Technology.

The three activities that possibly give me the most pleasure are reading, eating, and walking (not necessarily in that order). I also geek out over board games, public transit systems, pro-wrestling, electoral systems, and election predictions.

If you need advice on higher education applications/universities, or need advice on immigration processes, or are just depressed and need someone to talk to, you can always contact me at 'my website name' at 'the popular mail service provided by Google'. Please note that I am not a professional in any of these fields, but I will help as much as I can :-)
