My new year resolution for 2018 was to study (and not just skim through) at least one NLP research paper per day. Fourteen days into 2018, I am still going strong, creating a new record for the number of days I have been able to sustain my new year resolutions! Now that might be just me getting too pessimistic about the results of my previous new year resolutions, but anyway...

To build on this momentum, I added an additional component to the resolution - create an NLP blog and write about each paper I study.

First off, I had to decide which papers to study. Initially, I thought of going through the [arXiv cs.CL](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CL/new) submissions for the day and selecting the paper that interests me the most and studying and blogging about it, but I felt I was getting ahead of myself. Then I encountered this fantastic course on ['Neural Nets for NLP'](http://www.phontron.com/class/nn4nlp2017/) by [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/) at CMU. The course covers a wide array of NLP topics, 
and I was especially enthralled by the extensive [reference list](http://www.phontron.com/class/nn4nlp2017/schedule.html) assigned as additional reading material. The list includes some of my favorite NLP papers, some papers that were on my reading list but I never got around to reading, some papers that I never heard of but with tantalizing titles that piqued my interest.

My idea is to go through this list and study and blog about all the papers. The list is extensive enough that it will take about a year to get through it, and the papers are sufficiently state-of-the-art for 2017.

The blog posts will vary in format. While some posts will just summarize the paper, some posts will focus on a particular idea presented in a paper that is most interesting to me or that I feel has not recieved enough attention in the research community. As often as I can, I will try to accompany these posts by code and some experiments of my own.

The content will be written in a style that would cater to a person who is just getting started with NLP research. People are very welcome to join me and study and discuss the papers of the day!
